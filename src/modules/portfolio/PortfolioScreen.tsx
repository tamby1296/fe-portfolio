        I've worked closely with designers to translate Figma mockups into pixel-perfect interfaces and collaborated with back-end teams to integrate RESTful and GraphQL APIs. Projects include e-commerce platforms, financial dashboards, internal tools, and mobile-first web appsâ€”each demanding a strong focus on user experience, code quality, and maintainability.
